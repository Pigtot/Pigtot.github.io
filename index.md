## Who I Am and What I’m Interested In
Hi, I’m Thomas Li.  
As an innovator, I’m passionate about **solving problems** through creativity, CAD design, and technology. I’m fascinated by how small inventions can make life easier, reduce stress, and even address anxieties we often overlook.  

Out side the innovator circle, I have a deep interest in creative writing and poems. I am also an active tennis player. **Nadal is the GOAT**

## Experiences That Have Shaped Me

## My Goals
- Start and grow *Inventor*, a club that uses CAD and coding to solve daily problems and share them through videos.  
- Improve my problemsolving skills to the point where I can confidently build working solutions.  
- Use storytelling (film + media) to inspire others and make innovation accessible to anyone, not just engineers.
